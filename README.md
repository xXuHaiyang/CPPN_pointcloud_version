# Getting Started

## In softbot_robot.py
Implement the compute_work method in softbot_robot.py (line 117)

This method should assign a fitness for a given robot based on it's morphology.

## In job.py
Set Genotype hyperparameters (line 17-22)

Set AFPO hyperparameters (line 25-27)

# Running your experiments
1. In CPPN.Genome
comment line 12 and line 13
2. In Command Line
```
   mkdir run
   cd run
   python ../job.py <seed>
```
some seed: 3121, 1234
